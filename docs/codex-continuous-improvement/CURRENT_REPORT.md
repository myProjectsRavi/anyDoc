**Epic / Feature / Story:** E084 / F086 / US-R084-P1-01A



## Cycle 084 authoritative completion — 2026-10-16 UTC
- `E084/F086/US-R084-P1-01A` COMPLETE for bounded configured-folder symlink-leaf checks. Exact code/test SHA `0fe410393b950317fcaa390ada107fb4624f080e` passed draft-PR Actions #734 / API `38904369991`, job `116984725783`. All nine gates SUCCESS: domain JVM, PDF JVM, converter JVM, scanner JVM, PDF tools JVM, app JVM, debug APK, unsigned release/R8 and Android lint.
- Code `8fba5e6413d08fdccac81c9bd8eaf2fb3f76effb` rejects linked real/dangling child folders with NOFOLLOW checks; `58b06d0f983d82272a795ad6ec963985c10df110` adds four domain JVM regressions; `e78bea5b565658c3d173de4668e8f2b984950e52` adds the domain CI step. Initial #732 failed compiling the tests due missing JUnit; `0fe410393b950317fcaa390ada107fb4624f080e` adds `testImplementation(libs.junit4)` and #734 passed.
- Residual limitations: path checks are not atomic against concurrent directory swaps; Android OEM/device compatibility and performance are not certified. No physical-device or emulator evidence claimed. PR #1 remains draft/unmerged; `main` unchanged.

## Next audit checkpoint
The next engineering cycle must start with a bounded, evidence-backed code audit and an activated Epic/Feature/User Story checkpoint before production mutations. Prioritize remaining output-path race/alias risks and Android storage compatibility; do not imply race freedom without supporting facilities or instrumentation. Keep PR #1 draft and main untouched.
